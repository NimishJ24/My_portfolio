                            <p class="text-sm">Under the guidance of esteemed scientists at ISRO, my research focused on a critical bottleneck in interplanetary navigation: the high-variance, unpredictable nature of atmospheric density during spacecraft aerobraking. We identified that conventional static models introduce significant risk and are insufficient for ensuring mission safety. My primary contribution was the design and implementation of a lightweight, physics-guided machine learning model for real-time density estimation. By integrating an adaptive Kalman Filter, the system continuously learns from noisy, in-situ data, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy and robustness. This work represents a foundational step toward developing fully autonomous navigation systems capable of operating in uncertain extraterrestrial environments.</p>

                            <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-3">Pre-print: April 2025</p>
                            <p class="mb-3">My curiosity is intensely focused on the frontiers of AI, especially in making large language models more interpretable and trustworthy. This conviction led me to the field of Neuro-Symbolic AI. While deep learning excels at pattern recognition, it often operates as a 'black box.' In contrast, symbolic AI provides clear, logical reasoning but lacks adaptability. In this paper, my co-authors and I investigated how these two paradigms could be effectively bridged.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">We explored the integration of symbolic AI's reasoning capabilities with the pattern-recognition strengths of neural networks to build systems that can both learn from diverse data and reason about abstract concepts. Our goal is to contribute to an AI that is not only powerful but also transparent, reliable, and less susceptible to bias. This research reflects my commitment to advancing the field toward more robust and explainable artificial intelligence.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">Here, I use the 'strawberry' problem not just as a novelty, but as a case study to dissect the architectural limitations of LLMs. My analysis moves from identifying the tokenization flaw in earlier models to a deeper investigation of the 'Chain of Thought' mechanism in OpenAI's `o1`. I explore how reinforcement learning likely underpins this shift, demonstrating a move from simple pattern matching to a more structured, sequential reasoning process—a critical evolution for building more reliable AI.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">A provocative title demands rigorous scrutiny. In this post, I deconstruct Apple's paper on Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by questioning its core methodology. My analysis focuses on the use of classic puzzles for evaluation, which risks data contamination and may compromise the results. I probe the paper's conclusions, distinguishing between genuine model limitations and potential artifacts of their experimental design. It's my attempt to look past the hype and engage with the fundamental questions the research raises about how we truly measure progress in AI reasoning.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">My work on SafeSite AI began with a critical analysis of existing automated safety systems, which I found were often limited to simple object detection. This leads to a critical flaw: a high rate of false positives where the mere presence of an item, like a helmet on the ground, is incorrectly flagged as compliant. To address this, I engineered a more robust paradigm for safety monitoring.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">I designed a multi-stage validation pipeline that moves beyond presence detection to verify correct usage. The system integrates a YOLOv8 model for multi-class detection, instance segmentation to resolve ambiguities in crowded environments, and a novel rule-based engine for positional verification. This approach doesn’t just identify PPE; it contextualizes it, translating raw visual data into actionable safety intelligence. This project, currently undergoing the patent process, represents my commitment to building systems that solve real-world challenges through deep, domain-aware AI.</p>

                        <p class="mb-3">Beyond my formal research, I'm passionate about making complex AI concepts accessible and intuitive. As the Events Head for my university club, I conceived and led a flagship session for our tech festival, Gravitas, merging mental health, neuroscience, and AI. My goal was to move past conventional lectures and demonstrate my core understanding of neural networks through creative pedagogy.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">I designed an interactive, 3D "human neural network" game where participants became the neurons, ropes symbolized connections, and cards represented weights. This experiential approach was my solution for translating abstract theories—like weights, biases, and propagation—into tangible, memorable lessons. This initiative showcases my leadership in developing engaging educational formats and my ability to distill and communicate foundational AI principles creatively.</p>
